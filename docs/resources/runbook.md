# Shoreline_runbook (Resource)

Through Shoreline's web-based UI, Runbooks automatically capture an entire debug and remediation session -- which can optionally be associated with a specific Alarm -- and then be shared with other team members to streamline future incident response. With Runbooks you can:

- Create a series of interactive Op statement cells allowing you to execute Op commands within your browser -- all without installing or configuring the local CLI.
- Define and use dynamic parameters across Runbook Op cells.
- Memorialize Runbooks with historical snapshots.
- Add Markdown-based notes to inform operators how to use the Runbook.
- Associate existing Alarms and Runbooks, allowing on-call members to click through to an interactive debugging and remediation Runbook directly from the triggered Alarm UI.

## Required Properties

Each Runbook uses a variety of properties to determine its behavior. The required properties when creating a Runbook are:

- `name`: string - A unique symbol name for the Runbook object.
- `cells`: list(object) - A list of cells represented by JSON objects. Cells may either be Op statement cells or Markdown cells.

### Download a Runbook as a Terraform resource

You can download an entire Runbook directly as a Terraform resource. This will allow you to just plug in the TF code into your infrastructure and deploy the runbook immediately.

1. Click the **Actions** button on the right side of the active Runbook panel.
2. Select the **Download Runbook as Terraform** button to download the full configuration of the current Runbook as a Terraform resource.

## Defining a Runbook using the legacy `data` property

You can also export the Runbook's configuration as a JSON file and then freely modify, share, and upload this Runbook at any time.

Note: this way of defining is **deprecated**. Please refer to the above instructions using the new format.

The following example creates a Runbook named `my_runbook`.

1. Download a Runbook as JSON.
2. Only keep the `cells`, `params`, `external_params`, and `enabled` fields fron the JSON file. Note: `externalParams` needs to be renamed to `external_params` in the JSON file.
3. Save the Runbook JSON to local path within your Terraform project.
4. Define a new `Shoreline_runbook` Terraform resource in your Terraform configuration that points the `data` property to the correct local module path.

   ```terraform
resource "shoreline_runbook" "data_runbook" {
  name        = "data_runbook"
  description = "A sample runbook defined using the data field, which loads the runbook configuration from a separate JSON file."
  data        = file("${path.module}/data.json")
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `allowed_entities` (List of String) The list of users who can run a runbook. Any user can run if left empty.
- `allowed_resources_query` (String) The list of resources on which a runbook can run. No restriction, if left empty.
- `approvers` (List of String) List of users who can approve runbook execution
- `category` (String) Specifies the category for this runbook. To use categories, make sure your platform administrator has enabled the `ENABLE_RUNBOOK_CATEGORIES` setting. Once enabled, you can organize your runbooks by assigning them a category.
- `cells` (String) The data cells inside a runbook. Defined as a list of JSON objects encoded in base64. These may be either Markdown or Op commands. Shows diffs only when configuration changes.
- `communication_approval_notifications` (Boolean) Enables slack notifications for approval operations
- `communication_channel` (String) A string value denoting the slack channel where notifications related to the runbook should be sent to
- `communication_cud_notifications` (Boolean) Enables slack notifications for create/update/delete operations
- `communication_execution_notifications` (Boolean) Enables slack notifications for runbook executions
- `communication_workspace` (String) A string value denoting the slack workspace where notifications related to the runbook should be sent to
- `data` (String) JSON-encoded string containing the runbook data. This can be loaded from a file using the `file()` function, e.g., `data = file("${path.module}/runbook.json")`. Unlike other JSON fields (params, cells, external_params), this field only stores what the user sets and does not have a corresponding _full attribute.
- `description` (String) Description of the runbook
- `editors` (List of String) List of users who can edit the runbook (with configure permission). Empty maps to all users.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the runbook is enabled
- `external_params` (String) Runbook parameters defined via JSON path used to extract the parameter's value from an external payload, encoded as base64 JSON
- `filter_resource_to_action` (Boolean) Determines whether parameters containing resources are exported to actions
- `is_run_output_persisted` (Boolean) A boolean value denoting whether or not cell outputs should be persisted when running a runbook
- `labels` (List of String) A list of strings by which runbooks can be grouped
- `name` (String) The name of the runbook
- `params` (String) Named variables to pass to a runbook, encoded as JSON. Shows diffs only when configuration changes.
- `params_groups` (Attributes) Categorized parameter lists. Defaults to null if not specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--params_groups))
- `secret_names` (List of String) A list of strings that contains the name of the secrets that are used in the runbook.
- `timeout_ms` (Number) Maximum time to wait for runbook execution, in milliseconds

### Read-Only

- `cells_full` (String) Complete cells configuration returned by the API, including server-added fields. Shows diffs when external drift is detected and when configuration changes.
- `external_params_full` (String) Complete external parameter configuration returned by the API, including server-added fields. Shows diffs when external drift is detected and when configuration changes.
- `params_full` (String) Complete parameter configuration returned by the API, including server-added fields. Shows diffs when external drift is detected and when configuration changes.

<a id="nestedatt--params_groups"></a>
### Nested Schema for `params_groups`

Optional:

- `exported` (List of String) List of exported parameter names.
- `external` (List of String) List of external parameter names.
- `optional` (List of String) List of optional parameter names.
